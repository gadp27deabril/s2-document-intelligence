## FAQ

**Q: Can I use Community Edition commercially?**  
A: Yes! MIT license allows commercial use. You just won't have mobile apps, web dashboard, or advanced features.

**Q: What's the main difference between Community and Premium?**  
A: Community = core engine (PDF/OCR/API). Premium = mobile apps, web UI, advanced AI, enterprise features.

**Q: Why are mobile apps premium?**  
A: Mobile apps require App Store/Play Store presence, ongoing updates, mobile-specific features, and significant maintenance. It's a natural premium tier.

**Q: Can I see the Premium code before buying?**  
A: Beta partners get full access. Commercial customers get source code with license. Contact us for evaluation.

**Q: Will more features become open source over time?**  
A: Core processing features stay open. Mobile apps, web UI, and advanced AI will remain premium. We may open-source older premium features as we develop new capabilities.

**Q: Can I contribute to the open-source version?**  
A: Absolutely! We welcome contributions. See CONTRIBUTING.md in the repository.

**Q: Is the Premium worth $99/month?**  
A: Depends on your needs. If you just need document processing, Community is perfect. If you need mobile apps, web UI, or advanced features, Premium saves you months of development time.
